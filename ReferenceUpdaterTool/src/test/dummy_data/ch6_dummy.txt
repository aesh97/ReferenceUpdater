2 ?Hold? is a misnomer, because air is simply a collection of molecules and atoms that coexist passively with minimum, mostly unimportant interactions. So water vapor is not really ?held? by the air. Because the term is very commonly used, I nonetheless use it to mean the mass fraction of water molecules in a random air sample.
3 In truth, most animals host some fermentation, for which a rumen is not a must, because the hindgut (large intestine, colon) can play a rumen-like role. Just ask horses (who are not ruminants, yet who perfectly well subsist on grass because they rely on fermentation). Even we harbor some fermentation, but while it contributes importantly to our well being [40, 274, 263], its significance to our overall energy budget is very small or possibly even negative [103].
4 For the theoretically minded reader, I warmly recommend the relevant discussion (around pp. 542-545) of Geoff Vallis? incredibly clear and reader friendly Atmospheric and Oceanic Fluid Dynamics [515], especially his Fig. 13.1 (p. 544) which beautifully shows the stationary wave response described qualitatively above
